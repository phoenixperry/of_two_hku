##Generative Design in Open Frameworks contact@phoenixperry.com
Interactive Development HKU Spring 2015How do you make an interactive world feel alive? We will use programing to understanding reoccurring forms that often materialize in the world around us and we will mimic that behavior in this class. Topics covered will include:  vectors, physics, drawing techniques, noise, agents, particle systems, cellular automata, video, astar, dijkstra, machine learning, mobile and OSC. Course Objective: Participants will understand and experiment with natural phenomena as material for creative works. Students will produce a series of small experiments throughout the course that deepen creative thinking.Assignments: During the course of this project the student needs to develop 1 long term project that is pitched to the class, approved and developed over the duration of the term. This project must include a physical interface of some kind and be founded in conceptual footing that show an advanced understanding of interaction design in physical spaces. Programming references: http://www.learncpp.com/http://www.openframeworks.cc/https://sites.google.com/site/ofauckland/http://natureofcode.com/http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/codeBlog: http://www.dataisnature.com/Emergence.

It is recommended students also do yoga or some other stretching activity during the duration of the course to ensure healthy coding practices. Note: This class is very open ended. We might change what we cover week by week based on student input and where our exploration takes us. Week 1: What is a generative system? & video and a review Week 2: Vectors and Video Week 3: Forces Project pitches due Week 4: Oscillation Week 5: Particle Systems & OSC Week 6: Autonomous Agents & imagesProject check in Week 7: Cellular Automata &  mobile Week 8: Presentations
